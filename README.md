# What is this?
This is my first c project, it uses `ncurses.h` to show an animation of random characters bouncing around the terminal at random speeds.
## Why?
I was bored of web dev.
## How do i run this?
### Compilation:

#### Linux:
`gcc main.c -o charsoup -l ncurses`
#### Windows:
Just use wsl
#### MacOS:
God knows

### Running:
`./charsoup -n [number of characters]`
or
`./charsoup --number [number of characters]`

##### Please don't judge me too harshly, I'm not used to compiled, low level languages.
